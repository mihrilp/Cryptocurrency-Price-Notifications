# Cryptocurrency-Price-Notifications

[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/) <br><br>
A program that sends a notification to your phone when your cryptocurrency reaches the price you set. I used the popular automation website [IFTTT.](https://ifttt.com/home)
Also i used [Python-CoinMarketCap](https://pypi.org/project/python-coinmarketcap/) which is a Python package to wrap the CoinMarketCap API.<br>

To use this program youâ€™ll first need to set up a new account on [ifttt.com](https://ifttt.com/home) and install their mobile app.

## Usage
```
API_KEY = your api key
WEBHOOK_URL_KEY = your ifttt url key
```
