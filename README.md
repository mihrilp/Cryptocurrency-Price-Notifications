# Cryptocurrency-Price-Notifications

[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/) <br><br>
A program that sends a notification to your phone when your cryptocurrency reaches the price you set. I used the popular automation website [IFTTT.](https://ifttt.com/home)
Also i used [Python-CoinMarketCap](https://pypi.org/project/python-coinmarketcap/) which is a Python package to wrap the CoinMarketCap API.<br>


## Usage

For install packages
```
pip install python-coinmarketcap
pip install python-dotenv
```

Youâ€™ll first need to set up a new account on [ifttt.com](https://ifttt.com/home) and install their mobile app.
```
WEBHOOK_URL_KEY = your ifttt url key
```

And for use api you need sign up at [pro.coinmarketcap.com.](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/)
```
API_KEY = your api key
```
